1. I am taking this course because I have an interest in graphics. I have always been interested in how 
graphics are created and this course should be helpful for me. I am a visual person and seeing my work 
come to life excites me.

2. In this course I think we will learn about 2D, 3D and animated graphics as stated in the first course and syllabus material.
We will also have to learn how to use the linux environment and learn C++ as the programming language. Linear algebra will 
also be used.

3. Java, JavaScript, C. 
Java was my first programming language and I have been doing it for 3 years.
JavaScript was the language used for CSC337 web development and is similar to Java so I feel comfortable with it.
For C I have had only one or two working with it, but it was fairly easy to pick up.

4. I do not have any experience with C++ and I have not used STL before.

5. N/A (no C++ experience).

6. My favorite computer graphics are abstract art. I enjoy having abstract wallpapers as my backgrounds.
I like abstract because of the cool design. I usually appreciate any art in video games though (8bit, 3D, etc).

7. I have not seen any bad computer graphics. Even bad graphics I can still appreciate.

8. Something that I am interested in is technology in modern cars. Car manufacturers are coming out with features
such as a full 360 view of your car when backing up, self parking, and full digital dashboards.
